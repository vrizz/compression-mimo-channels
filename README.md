# Compression techniques for MIMO channels in FDD systems

Hello ðŸ‘‹ , this is the PyTorch code for reproducing the results of the paper: 'Compression Techniques For MIMO Channels in FDD Systems', presented in the IEEE DSLW 2022.

# Data download

The channel dataset can be downloaded here: 
After you have downloaded the dataset and you have put it in the same folder of the source-code, you can run the Python files `main_train_ae` and `main_train_ae_quant` successfully.
