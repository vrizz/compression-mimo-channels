# Compression techniques for MIMO channels in FDD systems

Hello ðŸ‘‹ , this is the PyTorch code for reproducing the results of the paper [Compression Techniques For MIMO Channels in FDD Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9820270), presented in the IEEE DSLW 2022 which received the Audice Choice Award.

# Data download

The channel dataset can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hr_qP8EMameVhbFwu2A1WMJJrZy14ucw/view?usp=sharing) as a `.zip` file.

After you have downloaded and extracted the dataset, and you have put it in the same folder of the source-code, you can run the Python files `main_train_ae` and `main_train_ae_quant` successfully.
